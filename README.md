# Real Estate

My aim in this project is to create a mobile and web compatible website where property ads are listed and we can create property ads. I also developed the backend part of my project myself. Users can log in and register. Registered users can create, update and delete ads. Users can view the postings by entering the location without registering. They can access the advertisements through the map and the list.
